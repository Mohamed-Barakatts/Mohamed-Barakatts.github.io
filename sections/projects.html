        <h4>Smart Chatbot - "Chatty"</h4>
        <p>"Chatty" is an interactive web-based chatbot application I created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The chatbot is designed to simulate conversation with users and provide responses based on predefined data. The project demonstrates the basics of creating an AI-like interface that interacts with users in real time, enhancing user engagement and providing a simple AI-driven communication experience.</p>
    
        <h5>Features:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interactive Chat Interface:</strong> The chatbot features a user-friendly interface with a text input field and a submit button, allowing users to type their messages and receive responses in real-time.</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable Responses:</strong> The chatbot's responses are customizable via a JavaScript file (<code>script.js</code>) that contains predefined data. This allows for flexible updates and enhancements to the chatbot's conversational abilities.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> The interface is designed using HTML and CSS, ensuring that the chatbot is accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.</li>
          <li><strong>Font Awesome Icons:</strong> Integrated icons from Font Awesome for a modern and visually appealing UI, enhancing the user's interactive experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Simple AI Simulation:</strong> While not powered by advanced AI algorithms, "Chatty" uses conditional logic and pattern matching to simulate a basic conversation, making it an excellent starting point for learning about chatbots.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>How It Works:</h5>
        <p>
          The chatbot operates through a straightforward JavaScript file that defines how it should respond to user input. When a user types a message in the input field and presses the button, the JavaScript function checks the input against a set of predefined patterns or keywords:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the user's message matches a predefined pattern, "Chatty" provides a relevant response.</li>
          <li>If no match is found, "Chatty" responds with a default message or prompts the user for more information.</li>
          <li>The conversation is displayed in a chat window, where user inputs and bot responses appear sequentially.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Usage:</h5>
        <p>
          "Chatty" can be embedded in any website to provide a basic interactive experience for users. It's perfect for simple FAQs, introductory conversations, or educational purposes where users can learn about basic programming logic and web development concepts.

        <h4>AI Face Detection and Blurring Application</h4>
        <p>This project is a Python-based application that utilizes OpenCV and the cvzone library to detect faces in a video feed and apply a blur effect to them. The application captures video in real-time from a webcam or processes a pre-recorded video file, detects faces using an AI-based model, and dynamically blurs each detected face for privacy protection.</p>
    
        <h5>Features:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-Time Face Detection</strong>: The application uses the <code>FaceDetector</code> class from the <code>cvzone</code> library to detect faces in each frame of the video feed in real time.</li>
          <li><strong>Face Blurring</strong>: Once a face is detected, the application applies a blur effect to the region of the face. The blurring area is dynamically adjusted to cover the entire face, providing effective privacy protection.</li>
          <li><strong>Video Processing</strong>: The application supports both real-time video capture from a webcam and processing of pre-recorded video files. It can write the processed video with blurred faces to a new video file (<code>output.mp4</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Customizable Blurring Effect</strong>: The blurring effect is customizable, allowing adjustments to the intensity and area of the blur applied to detected faces.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: The application displays the processed video feed in a window, allowing users to monitor the blurring in real time. Users can exit the application by pressing the 'q' key.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>How It Works:</h5>
        <p>
          The script starts by initializing the video capture object to capture frames from the webcam or a specified video file. It then creates an instance of the <code>FaceDetector</code> class to handle face detection. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each frame captured:
            <ul>
              <li>The <code>findFaces()</code> method detects faces and returns their coordinates.</li>
              <li>For each detected face, the coordinates are adjusted to cover a larger area (forehead to chin) and blurred using the <code>cv2.blur()</code> function.</li>
              <li>The blurred face region replaces the original face region in the video frame.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The processed frame is then written to an output video file and displayed to the user in a window.</li>
          <li>The loop continues until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Usage:</h5>
        <p>
          This application is ideal for ensuring privacy in video recordings, such as surveillance footage or personal videos. To use the application, run the script in a Python environment with OpenCV and cvzone installed. You can choose to capture video from your webcam or specify a path to a video file. The application will process the video and output a new video file with blurred faces.

        <h4>Snake Game - JavaScript</h4>
        <p>This project is a classic Snake game developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective is to control a snake to eat the food appearing on the board while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snake's own body. As the snake eats the food, it grows in length, making the game progressively more challenging.</p>

Collecting health kits increases the player's health, and missing an enemy decreases it. The game ends when the player's health reaches zero.</p>
    
        <h5>Technologies Used:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>HTML and CSS:</strong> Used to structure and style the game canvas and layout.</li>
          <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Implements the game logic, player controls, enemy movement, collision detection, and score/health management.</li>
          <li><strong>HTML5 Canvas:</strong> Renders the game graphics and animations.</li>

        <h4>Phone Number Information Extractor</h4>
        <p>This project is a Python-based script that extracts and displays detailed information about phone numbers. Utilizing the <code>phonenumbers</code> library, the script takes a phone number input from the user and provides various details such as the country code, national number, geographic location, carrier name, and timezone associated with the number.</p>
    
        <h5>Features:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Country Code and National Number Extraction</strong>: The script identifies and displays the country code and the national phone number format from the user's input.</li>
          <li><strong>Geographic Information</strong>: It determines the geographic location (region and country) of the phone number using the <code>geocoder</code> module from the <code>phonenumbers</code> library.</li>
          <li><strong>Carrier Information</strong>: The script provides the name of the carrier or service provider associated with the phone number using the <code>carrier</code> module.</li>
          <li><strong>Timezone Detection</strong>: It detects and displays the timezone(s) in which the phone number is registered using the <code>timezone</code> module.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: The script includes error handling to ensure that the entered number is valid. If the phone number format is incorrect or the number is invalid, it prompts the user to enter a real phone number.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>How It Works:</h5>
        <p>
          The script starts by importing necessary modules from the <code>phonenumbers</code> library. The user is prompted to enter a phone number with its country code. The script then attempts to parse the entered number using the <code>phonenumbers.parse()</code> method.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the number is valid, the script extracts and displays the following information:
            <ul>
              <li>Country Code and National Number</li>
              <li>Geographic Location (City and Country)</li>
              <li>Carrier Name</li>
              <li>Timezone(s) of the Phone Number</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If the entered number is invalid, the script displays an error message and terminates.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Usage:</h5>
        <p>
          This tool is useful for verifying phone numbers and obtaining information about them for various purposes, such as cybersecurity checks, data validation, and telecommunication analysis. To use the script, run it in a Python environment and input a phone number when prompted.

        <h4>Network Packet Sniffer and Port Scan Detector</h4>
        <p>This project is a Python-based network packet sniffer and port scan detector designed to monitor and analyze network traffic on a local network. Using the <code>scapy</code> library, the script captures network packets in real-time, identifies potential port scans, and tracks devices connected to the local network.</p>
    
        <h5>Features:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-Time Packet Sniffing</strong>: The script uses the <code>scapy</code> library to sniff network traffic in real time, capturing all IP packets on the network.</li>
          <li><strong>Port Scan Detection</strong>: By analyzing incoming packets, the script can detect potential port scans targeting devices on the local network. Port scans are often used by attackers to find open ports on a device, which can then be exploited.</li>
          <li><strong>Device Tracking</strong>: The script keeps track of unique IP addresses of devices connected to the local network. It identifies devices with IP addresses starting with "192.168.", which is a common range for private local networks.</li>
          <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring</strong>: Each packet detected is logged with a timestamp, source IP address, destination port, and the number of devices connected to the network. This information is printed to the console and optionally saved to a log file (<code>network_log.txt</code>) for further analysis.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>How It Works:</h5>
        <p>
          The script initializes by importing necessary modules from <code>scapy</code> and setting up a counter for the number of packets and a set to store unique local IP addresses. The core functionality is handled by the <code>detect_port_scan</code> function, which is called for each packet captured by the <code>sniff</code> function.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each packet, the function checks if it has an IP layer and retrieves the source IP address and destination port.</li>
          <li>If the source IP is within the local network range (<code>192.168.x.x</code>), it is added to the <code>connected_devices</code> set to track unique devices.</li>
          <li>The packet details, along with the timestamp and the count of connected devices, are logged to the console and saved to a log file.</li>
          <li>The <code>sniff</code> function continuously monitors the network interface for IP packets and passes them to the <code>detect_port_scan</code> function.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h5>Usage:</h5>
        <p>
          To use this network sniffer and port scan detector, run the script with appropriate permissions to access network interfaces. It is suitable for network administrators and cybersecurity enthusiasts to monitor network activity and detect potential threats in a local network environment.
